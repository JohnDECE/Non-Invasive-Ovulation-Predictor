# Non-Invasive-Ovulation-Predictor

### Motivation / Problem Statement
Many women track ovulation through the use of online apps or self tracking methods. However, these methods are error-prone and some are even invasive. This project will demonstrate the use of thermal cameras for tracking ovulation in a non-invasive way. The camera will be situated in a person’s bedroom aimed at the individual’s bed in order to monitor their body temperature during sleep. To maintain our non-invasive stance, the camera can be located as close as the edge of the bed or as far as the ceiling or wall of the room as long as we have a full body view of the sleeping individual.
