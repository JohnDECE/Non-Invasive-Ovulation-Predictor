# Non-Invasive-Ovulation-Predictor

### Motivation / Problem Statement
Many women track ovulation through the use of online apps or self tracking methods. However, these methods are error-prone and some are even invasive. This project will demonstrate the use of thermal cameras for tracking ovulation in a non-invasive way. The camera will be situated in a person’s bedroom aimed at the individual’s bed in order to monitor their body temperature during sleep. To maintain our non-invasive stance, the camera can be located as close as the edge of the bed or as far as the ceiling or wall of the room as long as we have a full body view of the sleeping individual.

### Hardware
 Seek Thermal Camera, Embedded Platform, Desktop App (Time Permitting)
 
### Design Goals

### Deliverables

### System Block Diagrams

### Hardware Requirements
Mobile: System can be setup in most envionrments and is easy to mount.
Efficient: System is not power hungry and can go lengths beetween charging. (Is this correct?!)
Thermal Camera: Camera works over a variety of distances. Camera is able to work in different sleeping positions.

### Software Requirements
Thermal Camera: Algorithm is able to throw away bad data vs. good data and will be able to differntiate between the two. 
Model: Model learns and trains with the specific user, and is able to gain accuracy over time.
Connectivity: System is able to wirelessly transmit the prediction score to a front end GUI (This is an app if time permits)

### Team Member Responsibilities
Brendan & Will: Building enclosure, setting up hardware, testing hardware, Wireless communication to front end GUI (App time permitting),
John & Alina: Thermal Camera software, training of model for predictive score
